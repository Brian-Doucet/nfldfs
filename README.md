<h1 align="center">Data for 2020 Season Now Available!</h1>


`nfldfs` is a Python package for NFL daily fantasy sports analysis. It provides an easy interface to scrape data for DraftKings, FanDuel, and Yahoo! from [rotoguru1](http://rotoguru.net) so that you don't have to.



* [Features](https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/daily-fantasy-sports#features)
* [Installation](https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/daily-fantasy-sports#installation)
* [Usage](https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/daily-fantasy-sports#usage)
  * [Work with it interactively](https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/daily-fantasy-sports#working-with-the-package-interactively)
  * [Use the CLI tool](https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/daily-fantasy-sports#using-the-cli)
* [Future Work](https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/daily-fantasy-sports#future-work)


## Features

+ Search for data using combinations of season and week
+ Return data only for the daily fantasy sites you care about
+ Work with results as a pandas DataFrame or use the CLI to output results directly to a `.csv`


## Installation
`nfldfs` is supported for Python 3 can be installed via pip:
```bash
pip install nfldfs
```
or from the repo (which may at times be more up-to-date):

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/nfldfs.git
cd nfldfs
python setup.py install
```
## Usage

If you're just looking for a bulk data download, it's recommended that you use the [CLI](https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/daily-fantasy-sports#using-the-cli) tool. It exports results directly to the `nfldfs/data` directory in `.csv` format. Head over there to see a [sample](https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/daily-fantasy-sports/tree/master/data) of DraftKings salary and points data for the entire 2017 season.

Here are some quick and dirty examples that illustrate how to work with the package interactively. For more robust examples and a data dictionary, refer to the [docs](https://github.com/BrianDoucet01/daily-fantasy-sports/tree/master/docs) folder.

### Working with the package interactively
Several examples to show how you could work with the package directly in [IPython](https://ipython.org/) or a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

**Get DraftKings salary and points data for the entire 2019 season.**

```Python
from nfldfs import games as games

# Scrape DraftKings salary and points data for the entire 2019 season
g = games.find_games('dk', 2019, 1, 2019, 17)
stats = games.get_game_data(g)

type(stats)
pandas.core.frame.DataFrame

# Confirm there's data for weeks 1-17
stats.week.unique()
array([ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17])

# Inspect a random sample of 10 rows

### Using the CLI
The command line interface (CLI) was designed for those who just want to download the raw data to use elsewhere; be it a database, Excel, Google Sheets, or another program.

You run the CLI tool by calling it directly from within the package directory. Results are sent to the `nfldfs/data` directory. Call `python cli.py --help` for more information on arguments and options.

**Example using the CLI to produce the DraftKings sample**
